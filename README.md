# The Kitchen

This is where I keep Chef cookbooks that I've developed, or made changes to. If you're looking for actual cookbooks, with food recipes, you want https://github.com/jellybob/recipe_book/ instead ;)

Each cookbook is on it's own branch, allowing me to track them individually. See http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Headless+Branches+for+Cookbook+Repositories for details.
